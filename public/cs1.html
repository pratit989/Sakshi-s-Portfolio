            What was their interpretation of it? What did they want to convey?
             These are the questions me and so many others ask when they are admiring an art piece.

            I took up this project as a part of Google’s UX Design Course. I’m more of an art enthusiast myself and from my first ever visit to an Art Gallery I felt like the experience could have been much more fulfilling. So I chose this prompt to create a compelling experience for Gallery visitors and myself.</h4>

        <h4>
            I’ve presented the case study in a linear fashion but I follow a lean approach towards designing. Sometimes I brainstorm a few ideas before I’ve conducted user research. It helps me to enter the problem more naturally. Or sometimes even when I’ve completed the research and I’m still prototyping, I constantly look for any new insights from potential users. 
I believe the process of designing is never ending because there’s no ‘Perfect’ design.

            <h3>Paper Wireframes</h3>
            <h4>
                I made initial paper wireframes based on the user pain points. I created various iteration of the same screen and evaluated the best one that solved user problem. Paper wireframes gave a rough sketch of what was to be included into the digital wireframes.
