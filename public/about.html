I have an insatiable appetite to create art. I’m also a very curious person who loves technology and people. All the three passions have coalesced into how I as an artist interpret my creativity through my designs. The ability to curate some of the best user experiences is something that I wish to build upon and improve. <br>

As an 19 year old, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the myriad career choices. I can still picture the lost student in me, trying out all the courses in search of something that I’m really passionate about. That’s when I came across Google UX Design Specialization on Coursera and all the mysteries began to unfold for me. I realized I loved to solve problems through designs with an humanistic approach. The vision of creating designs that communicate to a larger population, offering them to express themselves better and making their lives easier by intuitive designs is my driving force.
